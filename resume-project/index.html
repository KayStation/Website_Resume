                <img src="images/portrait.jpg" id="portraitImage">
                <p1>I’m Kay Station: A student, an I.T. employee, and a tech and law enthusiast who practices continual self-improvement and growth. I am currently finishing my AAS in Paralegal Studies, and I intend to transfer into a Bachelor’s degree in a technical field such as Information Systems or a business field like Marketing. I like to be a positive impact on my environment, be it the simple act of sharing kindness, figuring out how to help automate people’s mundane tasks, or bettering the security of information.</p1>

                    <h1>Why a Legal AAS?</h1>
                    <p1>As well as just enjoying learning it, I am a believer that soft skills transfer between different tasks far better than many think. I’m using the same skills that translate legalese into English when I’m troubleshooting computers or figuring out issues that I need to fix from end-users. </p1>

                <p1>In my free time, you can catch me taking online courses in topics that interest me such as UX Design, Marketing, and Tech. I also find time to do some amateur digital painting, as well as run tabletop games for friends and local groups.</p1>
